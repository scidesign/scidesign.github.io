<p>The tests will be written during class time (14:10 – 15:40) in a location to be announced.</p>
<p>You are allowed a two-sided 8-1/2“x 11” (standard letter size) hand-written aid sheet on the term test and a two-sided hand-written aid sheet on the final exam. You must bring your student identification to the term tests and the final exam.</p>
<p>You will not need to know R syntax on the tests and exam, but you will need to know how to interpret output from R.</p>
</div>
<div id="class-schedule" class="section level1">
<h1>Class Schedule</h1>
<p>A tentative class schedule can be found <a href="schedule_fall2019.html">here</a>.</p>
<div id="marking-concerns" class="section level2">
<h2>Marking concerns</h2>
<p>Any requests to have marked work re-evaluated must be made in writing to the instructor within one week of the date the work was returned. The request must contain a justification for consideration.</p>
</div>
<div id="missed-tests" class="section level2">
<h2>Missed Tests</h2>
<ul>
<li><p>If a test is missed for a valid reason, you must submit documentation to the course instructor.</p></li>
<li><p>If a test is missed for a valid medical reason, you must submit the <a href="http://www.illnessverification.utoronto.ca/index.php">University of Toronto Verification of Student Illness or Injury form</a> to your instructor within one week of the test.</p></li>
<li><p>The form will only be accepted as valid if the form is filled out according to the instructions on the form.</p></li>
<li><p>The form must indicate that the degree of incapacitation on academic functioning is moderate, serious, or severe in order to be considered a valid medical reason for missing the term test. If the form indicates that the degree of incapacitation on academic functioning is negligible or mild then this will NOT be considered a valid medical reason.</p></li>
<li><p>If a test is missed for a valid reason then half the weight of the test will be shifted to the other midterm and half will be shifted to the final exam. In this case the other term test will be worth 30% and the final exam will be worth 65%.</p></li>
<li><p>If a student misses <strong>BOTH</strong> term tests for any reason then an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oral_exam">oral exam</a> with members of the teaching team will be scheduled at a mutually convenient time in lieu of the two term tests worth 40%.</p></li>
<li><p>Students must complete at least one midterm test or oral exam. If a student misses both midterm tests and does not take an oral exam before the end of term then a grade of zero will be assigned to the term work.</p></li>
<li><p>Other reasons for missing a test will require prior approval by your instructor. If prior approval is not received for a non-medical reason, then you will receive a term test grade of zero.</p></li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="late-project-submission" class="section level2">
<h2>Late Project Submission</h2>
<p>If the draft/propsal project or final project is submitted after the due date then a late penalty of 20% per day (i.e., 24 hours) will be applied to the part of the project handed in late. For example, if the draft/proposal project is submitted after 5 days (including weekend days) then you will receive a grade of zero for the draft/proposal.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="computing" class="section level1">
<h1>Computing</h1>
<p>We will use R for all examples. R is freely available for download at <a href="http://cran.r-project.org" class="uri">http://cran.r-project.org</a> for Windows, Mac, and Linux operating systems. For the tests and exam, you will need to know how to interpret output from R.</p>
<div id="jupyter-notebook" class="section level2">
<h2>Jupyter Notebook</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>The Jupyter Notebook is an open-source web application that allows you to create and share documents that contain live code, equations, visualizations and narrative text. (Ref: <a href="https://jupyter.org" class="uri">https://jupyter.org</a>)</p>

<p>E-mail should only be used for emergencies or personal matters.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="how-to-communicate-with-your-instructor" class="section level1">
<h1>How to communicate with your instructor</h1>
<p>Questions about course material such as:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>How do I do question 3.7 in the textbook?</p></li>
<li><p>What is standard deviation?</p></li>
<li><p>When is the midterm?</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Can be posted on the discussion forums. Questions can be posted anonymously (so that the author is anonymous to other students but not to the instructors), if desired.</p>
<p>For private communication, such as: I missed the test because I was ill e-mail your instructor.</p>
<p>Use your utoronto.ca e-mail account to ensure that your message doesn’t automatically go to a Junk folder and include your full name and student number.</p>
</div>
<div id="religious-accommodation" class="section level1">
<h1>Religious Accommodation</h1>
<p>As a student at the University of Toronto, you are part of a diverse community that welcomes and includes students and faculty from a wide range of cultural and religious traditions. For my part, I will make every reasonable effort to avoid scheduling tests, examinations, or other compulsory activities on religious holy days not captured by statutory holidays. Further to University Policy, if you anticipate being absent from class or missing a major course activity (such as a test or in-class assignment) due to a religious observance, please let me know as early in the course as possible, and with sufficient notice (at least two to three weeks), so that we can work together to make alternate arrangements.</p>
</div>
<div id="students-with-disabilities-or-accommodation-requirements" class="section level1">
<h1>Students with Disabilities or Accommodation Requirements</h1>
<p>Students with diverse learning styles and needs are welcome in this course. If you have an acute or ongoing disability issue or accommodation need, you should register with Accessibility Services (AS) at the beginning of the academic year by visiting <a href="http://www.studentlife.utoronto.ca/as/new-registration" class="uri">http://www.studentlife.utoronto.ca/as/new-registration</a>. Without registration, you will not be able to verify your situation with your instructors, and instructors will not be advised about your accommodation needs. AS will assess your situation, develop an accommodation plan with you, and support you in requesting accommodation for your course work. Remember that the process of accommodation is private: AS will not share details of your needs or condition with any instructor, and your instructors will not reveal that you are registered with AS.</p>
</div>
<div id="academic-integrity" class="section level1">
<h1>Academic Integrity</h1>
<p>All students, faculty and staff are expected to follow the University’s guidelines and policies on academic integrity. For students, this means following the standards of academic honesty when writing assignments, collaborating with fellow students, and writing tests and exams. Ensure that the work you submit for grading represents your own honest efforts. Plagiarism—representing someone else’s work as your own or submitting work that you have previously submitted for marks in another class or program—is a serious offence that can result in sanctions. Speak to me or your TA for advice on anything that you find unclear.

<h1>Specific Medical Circumstances</h1>
<p>If you become ill and it affects your ability to do your academic work, consult me right away. Normally, I will ask you for medical documentation in support of your specific medical circumstances. The University’s Verification of Student Illness or Injury (VOI) form is recommended because it indicates the impact and severity of the illness, while protecting your privacy about the details of the nature of the illness. You can submit a different form (like a letter from a doctor), as long as it is an original document, and it contains the same information as the VOI. For more information, please see <a href="http://www.illnessverification.utoronto.ca" class="uri">http://www.illnessverification.utoronto.ca</a> If you get a concussion, break your hand, or suffer some other acute injury, you should register with Accessibility Services as soon as possible.</p>

<div id="accommodation-for-personal-reasons" class="section level1">
<h1>Accommodation for Personal Reasons</h1>
<p>There may be times when you are unable to complete course work on time due to non-medical reasons. If you have concerns, speak to me or to an advisor in your College Registrar’s office; they can help you to decide if you want to request an extension or accommodation. They may be able to provide you with a College Registrar’s letter of support to give to your instructors, and importantly, connect you with other resources on campus for help with your situation.</p>

<div id="your-responsibilities" class="section level1">
<h1>Your responsibilities</h1>
<p>The classroom sessions for this class are designed to actively engage you in the course material. We hope you’ll find them interesting, challenging, and fun, and an excellent opportunity to truly learn the material.</p>
